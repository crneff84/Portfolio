            <ul>
              <h3>Education</h3>
              <p>I attended the <em><span class="important">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</span></em> and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering</p>
              <h3>Work Experience</h3>
              <p>I served in the United States Air Force from 2002 to 2008 as a Russian linguist. After my service, I decided to attend college in order to attain a degree in engineering. After graduation, I worked as a Trainmaster for BNSF Railway. In this position, I managed train crews and coordinated the arrival and departure of trains from the Vancouver, Washington terminal. After approximately 2 years with BNSF Railway, I decided to take on an engineering role at HDR Engineering Inc. At HDR, I analyzed rail operations for federal and state governments. This included creating and analyzing rail operations models using rail simulation software.</p>
              <h3>Why I decided to take a class on programming</h3>
              <p>I have always had an interest in developing and building things. For a long time, I have wanted to try my hand at programming, but between work and other things I just never found the time. After learning about Epicodus, I decided that now was the right time to really devote my time to learning to progam.</p>
